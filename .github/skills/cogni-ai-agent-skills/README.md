# Cogni AI Agent Skills

[![PR Reviews][pr-reviews-image]][pr-reviews-link]
[![License][license-image]][license-link]

The primary purpose of this project/repository is to maintain technical skills commonly
used by AI agents to learn technical IT skills. These skills can be loaded into any
other repository by placing them into the `.github/skills/` directory, ideally
integrating this repository as a Git submodule.

This repository mirrors the structure and conventions of the
[Cogni-AI-OU/.github](https://github.com/Cogni-AI-OU/.github) organization repository.

## Adding this Repository as a Submodule

To load these skills into your own repository, you can add this repository as a Git submodule in the `.github/skills/` directory.

1. Navigate to the root of your repository.
2. Run the following command to add the submodule:

   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/Cogni-AI-OU/cogni-ai-agent-skills.git .github/skills/cogni-ai
   ```

3. Initialize and update the submodule:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

4. Commit the changes:

   ```bash
   git add .gitmodules .github/skills/cogni-ai
   git commit -m "feat: add cogni-ai-agent-skills submodule"
   ```

## What This Repository Provides

This repository includes the standard operations infrastructure and AI agent skills for
Cogni-AI-OU projects:

### Key Features

- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: CI/CD and automation (OpenCode, pre-commit, etc.)
- **AI Agent Configurations**: AGENTS.md, skills, and prompts for automated development
- **Coding Instructions**: Language-specific standards in `.github/instructions/`
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Linting and validation tooling
- **Code Tours**: Guided walkthroughs for repository onboarding

## Getting Started

1. Install the local validation tooling:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pip install -r .devcontainer/requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the repository checks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run -a
   ```

3. Review the core guidance:
   - This README for repository scope and the local workflow
   - [.tours/getting-started.tour](.tours/getting-started.tour) for a guided walkthrough
   - [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for repository-specific agent guidance

## Development

### Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Install Python dependencies (for devcontainer)
pip install -r .devcontainer/requirements.txt
```

### Testing and Validation

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
pre-commit run -a

# Run specific checks
pre-commit run markdownlint -a
pre-commit run yamllint -a
pre-commit run black -a
pre-commit run flake8 -a
```
