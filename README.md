# Cogni AI OÜ - Organization Configuration

This is a special `.github` repository that provides default community health
files and configurations for all repositories in the Cogni AI OÜ organization.

## What is a .github Repository?

The `.github` repository is a special GitHub repository that serves as a central
location for organization-wide defaults. It automatically provides community
health files (like issue templates, code of conduct, contributing guidelines,
etc.) to any repository in the organization that doesn't have its own versions.

### Key Features

- **Default Issue Templates**: Standardized bug reports, feature requests, and
  other issue types
- **Code of Conduct**: Organization-wide behavioral standards
- **Contributing Guidelines**: How to contribute to projects
- **Pull Request Templates**: Standardized PR descriptions
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Reusable CI/CD and automation workflows
- **Organization Profile**: Public-facing information via `profile/README.md`
- **AI Agent Configurations**: Enhanced agents and skills for automated development

### How It Works

1. Files in individual repositories' `.github/` directories take precedence over
   these defaults
2. If a repository doesn't have a specific file, GitHub falls back to this
   repository
3. Changes here automatically apply organization-wide

## Getting Started

1. Install the local validation tooling:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pip install -r .devcontainer/requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the repository checks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run -a
   ```

3. Review the core guidance:
   - This README for repository scope and the local workflow
   - [.tours/getting-started.tour](.tours/getting-started.tour) for a guided walkthrough
   - [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for repository-specific agent guidance

## Development

### Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Install Python dependencies (for devcontainer)
pip install -r .devcontainer/requirements.txt
```

### Testing and Validation

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
pre-commit run -a

# Run specific checks
pre-commit run markdownlint -a
pre-commit run yamllint -a
pre-commit run black -a
pre-commit run flake8 -a
```

## Project Layout

- `.github/`: default templates, workflows, instructions, prompts, skills, and agent configuration
- `.tours/`: guided walkthroughs for repository onboarding
- `profile/`: the public organization profile shown on GitHub
- `AGENTS.md`: repository-specific guidance for automation agents
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: organization-wide community standards
- `README.md`: repository overview and local development workflow

## AI Agents

This repository provides AI agent configurations for automated development.

### Agent Configuration Files

| File/Directory | Audience | Purpose |
